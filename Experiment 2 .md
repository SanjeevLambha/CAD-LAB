# EXPERIMENT – 2
Title: Isometric Drawing using AutoCAD (2D)

1. Objective
To create isometric drawings of basic solids (cone, cylinder, and objects) using AutoCAD.

2. Software Required
AutoCAD (2D)
3. Theory (Short)

Isometric drawing is a method for visually representing 3D objects in 2D, where:

All three axes are equally inclined (120° apart)
Dimensions are drawn to scale along isometric axes
Circles appear as ellipses (isocircles)
4. Important AutoCAD Settings for Isometric Drawing
Step 1: Start AutoCAD
Open AutoCAD → New Drawing
Step 2: Set Units
Type UNITS → Enter
Set:
Type: Decimal
Insertion scale: Millimeters
Step 3: Enable Isometric Mode
Type DSETTINGS → Enter
Go to Snap and Grid tab
Under Snap Type → Select Isometric Snap
Click OK
Step 4: Switch Isoplanes

Use:

F5 or Ctrl + E

Three planes:

Isoplane Top
Isoplane Left
Isoplane Right
5. Basic Commands Used
Command	Use
LINE	Draw edges
ELLIPSE	Draw isocircles
OFFSET	Parallel lines
TRIM	Remove extra lines
DIM	Dimensioning
6. PROCEDURE
6.1 Drawing an Isometric Cylinder
Given Dimensions (Example)
Diameter = 40 mm
Height = 60 mm
Steps:
Switch to Isoplane Top
Type ELLIPSE → Enter
Type I (Isocircle)
Specify center → Draw circle (Ø40)
Switch to Isoplane Left/Right
Draw vertical lines (height = 60 mm)
Copy top circle upward
Join edges using LINE
Trim extra lines
6.2 Drawing an Isometric Cone
Given Dimensions
Base diameter = 40 mm
Height = 60 mm
Steps:
Set Isoplane Top
Draw base isocircle using ELLIPSE → Isocircle
Find center of base
Draw vertical axis line (height = 60 mm)
Mark apex point
Join apex to circle edges using LINE
Remove hidden lines if required
6.3 Isometric View of Object (Block Example)
Given Dimensions
Length = 80 mm
Width = 50 mm
Height = 40 mm
Steps:
Draw base rectangle using isometric lines
Use:
30° lines for width
Horizontal for length
Complete base
Draw vertical edges (height)
Join top face
Add features (holes, cuts if required)
Use isocircles for circular features
7. Dimensioning in Isometric Drawing
Step:
Type DIM
Use:
DIMLINEAR
DIMALIGNED

⚠ Note:

Dimensions are usually added in orthographic drawings, but basic dimensions can be shown for clarity.
8. Precautions
Always check correct Isoplane (F5)
Use Isocircle instead of CIRCLE
Maintain proper alignment
Avoid overlapping lines
9. Result

Isometric drawings of cone, cylinder, and object were successfully created using AutoCAD.
